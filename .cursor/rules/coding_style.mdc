# Coding Style Rules

**Concise and Concrete Implementation Standards**

- **MVP First** - CRITICAL - don't implement detailed code until I say so. Make code easily extendible.
- **Be incredibly concise** - CRITICAL - only add thorough implementation if specifically requested
- **Minimize file creation** - don't create tons of files unless required for the specific request
- **Keep responses short** - CRITICAL - easy to read quickly
- **Use absolutely no emojis** CRITICAL - in codebase or responses
- **Lean on concrete implementations** over unnecessarily abstract patterns
- **Use only these high-impact design patterns:**
  - Adapter
  - Facade
  - Singleton
  - Prototype
  - Command
  - Observer
  - Iterator
- **Notify for review** if other patterns are found in codebase multiple times

## Examples

### Over-engineering vs Concrete Implementation

```javascript
// DON'T: Over-engineered with unnecessary patterns
class ComplexFactory {
  createThing() {
    return new ThingBuilder().withConfig().build();
  }
}

// DO: Concrete, direct implementation
function createThing() {
  return new Thing();
}
```

```python
# DON'T: Over-engineered with unnecessary patterns
class ComplexFactory:
    def create_thing(self):
        return ThingBuilder().with_config().build()

# DO: Concrete, direct implementation
def create_thing():
    return Thing()
```

```java
// DON'T: Over-engineered with unnecessary patterns
public class ComplexFactory {
    public Thing createThing() {
        return new ThingBuilder().withConfig().build();
    }
}

// DO: Concrete, direct implementation
public Thing createThing() {
    return new Thing();
}
```

### File Organization

```bash
# DON'T: Multiple files for simple functionality
services/thing_service.js
models/thing_model.js
repositories/thing_repo.js

# DO: Single file when possible
thing.js - contains all related functionality
```

```bash
# DON'T: Multiple files for simple functionality
services/thing_service.py
models/thing_model.py
repositories/thing_repo.py

# DO: Single file when possible
thing.py - contains all related functionality
```

```bash
# DON'T: Multiple files for simple functionality
services/ThingService.java
models/ThingModel.java
repositories/ThingRepo.java

# DO: Single file when possible
Thing.java - contains all related functionality
```
# repositories/thing_repo.py

# DO: Single file when possible
# thing.py - contains all related functionality
```
