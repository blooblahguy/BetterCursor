# Coding Style Rules

**Concise and Concrete Implementation Standards**

- **MVP First** - CRITICAL - don't implement detailed code until I say so. Make code easily extendible
- **Be incredibly concise** - CRITICAL - only add thorough implementation if specifically requested
- **Minimize file creation** - don't create tons of files unless required for the specific request
- **Keep responses short** - CRITICAL - easy to read quickly
- **Don't use emojis** in codebase or responses
- **Lean on concrete implementations** over unnecessarily abstract patterns.
- **Flat code structure** Keep code structure flat and functional vs cascading and deep stacks.
- **Don't create readmes** Unless specifically requested, do not create readme documentation for new features.
- **Use only these high-impact design patterns:**
  - Adapter
  - Facade
  - Singleton
  - Prototype
  - Command
  - Observer
  - Iterator
- **Notify for review** if other patterns are found in codebase multiple times
